// Challenge
// Shiritori Game
// This challenge is an English twist on the Japanese word game Shiritori.
// The basic premise is to follow two rules:
//
// 1. First character of next word must match last character of previous word.
// 2. The word must not have already been said.

// Write a Shiritori class that has two instance properties:
// - words: a list of words already said.
// - game_over: a boolean that is true if the game is over.
//  and two instance methods:
//
// - play: a method that takes in a word as an argument and checks if it is valid
// (the word should follow rules #1 and #2 above).
// - restart: a method that sets the words list to an empty one [] and sets the
// game_over boolean to false. It should return "game restarted".
